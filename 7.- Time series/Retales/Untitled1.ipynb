    "Python datetime Classes\n",
    "Before jumping into writing code, it’s worth looking at the five main object classes that are used in the datetime module. Depending on what we’re trying to do, we’ll likely need to make use of one or more of these distinct classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "datetime – Allows us to manipulate times and dates together (month, day, year, hour, second, microsecond).\n",
    "\n",
    "date – Allows us to manipulate dates independent of time (month, day, year).\n",
    "\n",
    "time – Allows us to manipulate time independent of date (hour, minute, second, microsecond).\n",
    "\n",
    "timedelta— A duration of time used for manipulating dates and measuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "tzinfo— An abstract class for dealing with time zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "If those distinctions don’t make sense yet, don’t worry! Let’s dive into datetime and start working with it to better understand how these are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Date Objects\n",
    "First, let’s take a closer look at a datetime object. Since datetime is both a module and a class within that module, we’ll start by importing the datetime class from the datetime module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we’ll print the current date and time to take a closer look at what’s contained in a datetime object. We can do this using datetime‘s .now() function. We’ll print our datetime object, and then also print its type using type() so we can take a closer look.\n",
    "\n",
    "# import datetime class from datetime module\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "# get current date\n",
    "datetime_object = datetime.now()\n",
    "print(datetime_object)\n",
    "print('Type :- ',type(datetime_object))\n",
    "2019-10-25 10:24:01.521881\n",
    "Type :-  \n",
    "We can see from the results above that datetime_object is indeed a datetime object of the datetime class. This includes the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract Year and Month from the Date\n",
    "Now we’ve seen what makes up a datetime object, we can probably guess how date and time objects look, because we know that date objects are just like datetime without the time data, and time objects are just like datetime without the date data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also antipate some problems. For example, in most data sets, date and time information is stored in string format! Also, we may not want all of this date and time data — if we’re doing something like a monthly sales analysis, breaking things down by microsecond isn’t going to be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, let’s start digging into a common task in data science: extracting only the elements that we actually want from a string using datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to do a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Date and Time Strings with strptime() and strftime()\n",
    "Thankfully, datetime includes two methods, strptime() and strftime(), for converting objects from strings to datetime objects and vice versa. strptime() can read strings with date and time information and convert them to datetime objects, and strftime() converts datetime objects back into strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, strptime() isn’t magic — it can’t turn any string into a date and time, and it will need a little help from us to interpret what it’s seeing! But it’s capable of reading most conventional string formats for date and time data (see the documentation for more details). Let’s give it a date string in YYYY-MM-DD format and see what it can do!\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = '2019-10-31'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create date object in given time format yyyy-mm-dd\n",
    "my_date = datetime.strptime(my_string, \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_date)\n",
    "print('Type: ',type(my_date))\n",
    "2019-10-31 00:00:00 Type:  \n",
    "Note that strptime() took two arguments: the string (my_string) and \"%Y-%m-%d\", another string that tells strptime() how to interpret the input string my_string. %Y, for example, tells it to expect the first four characters of the string to be the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full list of these patterns is available in the documentation, and we’ll go into these methods in more depth later in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have noticed that a time of 00:00:00 has been added to the date. That’s because we created a datetime object, which must include a date and a time. 00:00:00 is the default time that will be assigned if no time is designated in the string we’re inputting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, we were hoping to separate out specific elements of the date for our analysis. One way can do that using the built-in class attributes of a datetime object, like .month or .year:\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Month: ', my_date.month) # To Get month from date\n",
    "print('Year: ', my_date.year) # To Get month from year\n",
    "Month:  10 Year:  2019\n",

    "Getting Day of the Month and Day of the Week from a Date\n",
    "Let’s do some more extraction, because that’s a really common task. This time, we’ll try to get the day of the month and the day of the week from my_date. Datetime will give us the day of the week as a number using its .weekday() function, but we can convert this to a text format (i.e. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday…) using the calendar module and a method called day_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start by importing calendar, and then using .day and .weekday() on my_date. From there, we can get the day of the week in text format like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "# import calendar module\n",
    "import calendar\n",
    "print('Day of Month:', my_date.day)\n",
    "\n",
    "# to get name of day(in number) from date\n",
    "print('Day of Week (number): ', my_date.weekday())\n",
    "\n",
    "# to get name of day from date\n",
    "print('Day of Week (name): ', calendar.day_name[my_date.weekday()])\n",
    "Day of Month: 31 Day of Week (number):  3 Day of Week (name):  Thursday\n",
    "Wait a minute, that looks a bit odd! The third day of the week should be Wednesday, not Thursday, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a closer look at that day_name variable using a for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "j = 0\n",
    "for i in calendar.day_name:\n",
    "    print(j,'-',i)\n",
    "    j+=1\n",
    "0 - Monday 1 - Tuesday 2 - Wednesday 3 - Thursday 4 - Friday 5 - Saturday 6 - Sunday\n",
    "Now we can see that Python starts weeks on Monday and counts from the index 0 rather than starting at 1. So it makes sense that the number 3 is converted to “Thursday” as we saw above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Hours and Minutes From a Python Datetime Object\n",
    "Now let’s dig into time and extract the hours and minutes from datetime object. Much like what we did above with month and year, we can use class attributes .hour and .minute to get the hours and minutes of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s set a new date and time using the .now() function. As of this writing, it’s October 25, 2019 at 10:25 AM. You’ll get different results depending on when you choose to run this code, of course!\n",

    "\n",
    "We can get the year, week of the year, and day of the week from a datetime object with the .isocalendar() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, isocalendar() returns a tuple with ISO year, week number and weekday. The ISO calendar is a widely-used standard calendar based on the Gregorian calendar. You can read about it in more detail at that link, but for our purposes, all we need to know is that it works as a regular calendar, starting each week on Monday.\n",

    "todays_date.isocalendar()\n",
    "(2019, 43, 5)\n",
    "Note that in the ISO calendar, the week starts counting from 1, so here 5 represents the correct day of the week: Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the above that this is the 43rd week of the year, but if we wanted to isolate that number, we could do so with indexing just as we might for any other Python list or tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "todays_date.isocalendar()[1]\n",
    "43\n",
    "Converting a Date Object into Unix Timestamp and Vice Versa\n",
    "In programming, it’s not uncommon to encounter time and date data that’s stored as a timestamp, or to want to store your own data in Unix timestamp format.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do that using datetime’s built-in timestamp() function, which takes a datetime object as an argument and returns that date and time in timestamp format:\n",

    "python datetime tutorial - timedelta and time span\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring Time Span with Timedelta Objects\n",
    "Often, we may want to measure a span of time, or a duration, using Python datetime. We can do this with its built-in timedelta class. A timedelta object represents the amount of time between two dates or times. We can use this to measure time spans, or manipulate dates or times by adding and subtracting from them, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default a timedelta object has all parameters set to zero. Let’s create a new timedelta object that’s two weeks long and see how that looks:\n",

    "\n",
    "year = timedelta(days=365)\n",
    "print(year)\n",
    "365 days, 0:00:00\n",
    "Now let’s start doing using timedelta objects together with datetime objects to do some math! Specifically, let’s add a few diffeent time durations to the current time and date to see what date it will be after 15 days, what date it was two weeks ago.\n",

    "To do this, we can use the + or - operators to add or subtract the timedelta object to/from a datetime object. The result will be the datetime object plus or minus the duration of time specified in our timedelta object. Cool, right?\n",
